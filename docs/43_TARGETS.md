## Update protocol

1. At start of cycle: load this file + A11_MASTER_RECORD.md + decision-log.
2. Execute the smallest useful open target.
3. Change status only with evidence (commit SHA, live URL, log).
4. Append a one-line outcome under ## Cycle log below.
5. Never invent completed status.

## Cycle log

- 2026-08-25 | Seed created and committed. Master record already VERIFIED (target 15). Next: advance targets 18–22 (commercial + Operator/Trust surfaces).
- 2026-08-25 | SEO 01–04 VERIFIED on a11-k.space. Added canonical, robots meta, Open Graph, Twitter cards, dual JSON-LD (Organization + WebSite), noscript fallback, sitemap.xml, robots.txt Sitemap directive. Commits: 71b110f, 2923ee9, 8f3a7aa. Target 14 (security headers) already present via vercel.json. Next: commercial surfaces 18–22 + force Vercel redeploy of a11k so live HTML reflects new head tags.
