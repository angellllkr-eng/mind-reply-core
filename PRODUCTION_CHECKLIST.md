## DEPLOYMENT STEPS

After verification evidence is recorded:

1. **Create production branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b release/production-v1
   ```

2. **Tag release**
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Production release"
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

3. **Trigger deployment**
   - Via GitHub Actions: Merge PR to main
   - Via Vercel: Deploy from dashboard
   - Via manual: `git push origin release/production-v1`

4. **Verify deployment**
   ```bash
   curl https://mind-reply.com/health
   # Expected: { "status": "ok" }
   ```

5. **Monitor first 24 hours**
   - Watch uptime monitoring
   - Watch error logs
   - Watch performance metrics
   - Be ready to rollback

---

## ROLLBACK PROCEDURE

If production fails:

1. **Identify issue**
   - Check error logs
   - Check monitoring alerts
   - Check deployment status

2. **Rollback** (choose one)
   - **Vercel:** Click "Rollback" in dashboard to previous deployment
   - **Docker:** `docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down && docker pull {previous_image} && docker-compose up -d`
   - **GitHub:** Revert commit + push

3. **Verify**
   ```bash
   curl https://mind-reply.com/health
   curl https://mind-reply.com/  # Verify homepage loads
   ```

4. **Post-incident**
   - Document what failed
   - Update monitoring
   - Schedule post-mortem
   - Update runbooks
